## Notes
- Drama between the House [[Esoteric]] and the house [[Ebrius]] needs an independent third party to intervene and resolve the issues.
- [[The Void]] was recruited by [[Lady Fortuna|Lady Fortuna]]
- After a brief conversation with [[Adoras Adalet|Lord Adalet]] the party went to investigate the situation.
- [[Esoteric]] claims [[Ebrius]] is delaying the order.
- [[Ebrius]] claims the order is too big
	- -> turns out they suspect [[Esoteric]] of doing magical experiments without declaring it to the council.
- The party talked to [[Maxwell Foxwell]] (House [[Foxwell]] is a vassal house of [[Esoteric]])
	- House [[Flanel]] (another vassal house of [[Esoteric]]) seems to have ordered a *lot* of magic components.
- The party talked to heads of the houses [[Kaevorin]], [[Vaynar]], and [[Ebrius]]
	- They think House [[Esoteric]] is planning to continue the [[Rune Project]].
- The party talked to House [[Naz]].
	- House [[Flanel]] and [[Esoteric]] are virtually impossible to talk to.
	- The ingredients line up with the [[Rune Project]].
- The party reported back to [[Lady Fortuna]] and [[Adoras Adalet]]
- -> The Council will take action accordingly and require the House [[Esoteric]] to report on the nature of their order
- -> After [[Esoteric]] has declared their intentions, all materials will be delivered within 2 days time.
- -> The Contract between [[Esoteric]] and [[Ebrius]] will most likely be tightened so they can't just delay shipments for no reason or with malicious intent.
