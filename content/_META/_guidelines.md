## Rules of the Wiki
1. Never name an article starting with "**The**".
2. Shorten article names when possible, put the full name as an alias and/or header. E.g.: Remove "Kingdom of ..."
3. Keep notes in the correct folder, do not makes sub-folders:
	- `/_META` for things about the wiki itself
	- `/Session Reports` and `/Player Characters` for the relevant articles (which are also tagged respectively)
	- `/World Notes`  for everything else
4. Make articles atomic and typed with tags.
	- Keep articles (not session reports) about only 1 thing and embed (`![[articlename]]`) articles in groupings.
	- Use the correct tag with the correct article, at the first line of the article. See [Tags]( https://void.tarragon.be/tags/ ) for details on the tags and when to use them.
	- ❗All tags should be fully lowercase
5. Try to avoid making **orphans** (files that don't like to, or from, anywhere). These make navigating the wiki more difficult.
