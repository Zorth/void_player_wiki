# Callouts
Callouts are used to section off information into blocks that are visible and colored. Stick to the dedicated use for predefined callouts in order to avoid confusion.

> [!abstract]
> Aliases: "abstract", "summary", "tldr"
> Abstracts are used for summaries, often for [[session|Session Note]]s.

> [!quote]
> Aliases: "quote", "cite"
> Quotes are used when specifically citing information given by a voidmaster that is written word-for-word. Information in here is good to trace back to it source. If a given quote is to be proven false, it can be determined the NPC lied and not that notes taken were incorrect, because the quote must be cited correctly from the words of the voidmaster.
