#location [[Zenith]]

The uncharted lands in the north of [[Zenith]], thick fog surrounds its borders and not much is known about it.

> [!info]
> Level range seems to be ~10th level

Creatures have been spotted coming out of the fog, attacking the borders of the [[Satsuma|Satsuma Shogunate]].

> [!question]
> - What/who hides here and what are their plans?
> - Was this always here?
> - Can we map out these lands?
