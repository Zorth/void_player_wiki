Born on the [[Shadush|sun-scorched outskirts of Shadush]], where the dunes whisper in orcish and the wind remembers old wars, Kain Dorskar came into the world marked by storm. A half-orc of the desert’s edge, his first cry was met not by silence but by thunder — a sky-dragon’s blessing coursing through his blood.

Wielding a greatsword that hums with the echo of lightning, Kain walks the path of the draconic instinct, a barbarian whose rage crackles like stormfire and whose heart beats with fierce, untamed loyalty. Cast out by those who saw only what he was not, he learned early that strength means little without someone to protect.

Trained by a wandering band of mercenaries after the fall of his home and the death of his mother, he forged himself into a weapon with purpose — to guard, to avenge, to endure. In the [[The Void]], he found his half-brother [[Gorak]], only to lose him to a vampire’s hunger. The wound left by that night never closed; it merely hardened.

Now Kain seeks more than battle — he hunts meaning in power. Whether his path leads him to become Barbarian Lord or Orc Lord, even he cannot say. He only knows the storm within him grows louder each day, and when it breaks, the world will hear his name.
