🍄✨ BRAMBLE THE MUSHROOM LESHY !✨🍄 Certified Crunchy Dirt Child™ | Buff Baby of the Spores | Emotionally available FUNGUS “

Hewooo!!! Am Bwamble!!!!” is the last thing you hear before a 2-foot mycelium muscle goblin hugs you with the force of a thousand hugs. Bramble is 90% love, 10% dirt, 100% ready to throw hands for his friends and kiss your boo-boos better. 

He lives in a log. He eats rocks sometimes. His concept of battle strategy is “run at it screaming and believe in love.” It works 80% of the time. 

His brodda? His ride or die. His fwends? Sacred. You? Stranger? You’re family now. Here, take a leaf. !🍃 

Mid-sentence? Distracted. Mid-fight? Hug break. Mid-quest? Ant. There was an ant. They’re following it now. The ant is the new main character. Bwamble has imprinted. 

“AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADVENTUW AWAITS!! WESGOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO NETTLES!!” 
Actual war cry from a leshy chasing an ant into the woods for 3 hours. You will not be getting him back.
