A dragonfruit leshy wizard of curious mind and gentle humor, Pitaya wanders the realms in service to both scholarship and adventure. Draped in star-embroidered robes and ever leaning on his gleaming staff, he writes with care for those who follow after him, blending whimsy with wisdom. Though small in stature, his spirit carries the quiet strength of ancient groves, and his words often bless companions with guidance drawn from both leaf and lore.
